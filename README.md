### Documents and API used to create my Final Project for IBM Developing Cloud Apps with Node.js and React (Completed January 2022)

## Final Project Objective
The project consists of server-side applications in Node.js using the Express.js framework. And on the client side, a dynamic application using the React.js framework.

The proposed scenario is that of a research company that needs to create a new site that allows finding feelings and emotions in the text using the services of IBM Watson.

The app was built using Express.js on the backend and React.js on the frontend app.

The application is published to IBM Cloud services using the Cloud Foundry service.
